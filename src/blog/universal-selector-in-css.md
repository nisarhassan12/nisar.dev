Selectors allow us to target HTML elements and apply CSS styles to them. The CSS  __Universal Selector *__ targets all the element types on a page.  It is oftentimes reffered to as the "wildcard" selector(this term is not entirely accurate). It targets all elements types regardless of structure.


## Syntax

To write a Universal selector you just type `*` as shown and that's it.

```css
* {
    color: red;
}
```
